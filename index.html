              Do Not Track (DNT) is a concept that has been promoted by us regulatory authorities, in particular the

              allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.

          The service may contain content inappropriate for children under the age of 13. As a parent, you should know
          that through the service, children under the age of 13 may participate in activities that involve the
          collection or use of personal information. We use reasonable efforts to ensure that before we collect any
          personal information from a child, the child's parent receives notice of and consents to our personal
          information practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of users between 13 and 18 years old.
          In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality of the service to these users. If
          we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent
          from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may ask a user to verify their date of birth before collecting any personal information from them. If the
          user is under the age of 13, the service may be either blocked or redirected to a parental consent process.
